# CS-330

During the designing of my 3D scene project I ensured that I understood the requirements at hand prior to proceeding with any design layout, once the requirements were fully understood I hand drew the desired results I was looking for with potential functions that would be required for each item I drew, in doing so I provided myself with a starting template and proceeded to implement the design and modify it as needed. Although hand sketching may not be the most professional method, I may still apply this to future jobs as it is a quick way for me to jot down ideas and allows me to review my thoughts and analyze them deeper and adjust. 
When developing this program, I used my understanding of object-oriented programming principles to help organize and structure my code in a more industry standard way. I also learned a deeper understanding of debugging programs and the importance of utilizing terminal messages to help discover bugs within my code. During the development of this program I continuously tested, tweaked, and refactored code to ensure that my program continuously improved, although this program could use additional refactoring it has improved greatly. My code has evolved greatly from the beginning of this course, my original code did not utilize OOP principles, and everything was crammed into the main function, Refactoring the code allowing for more mouldability was a crucial aspect of my program succeeding later in the course. 
I believe this course has provided me with better problem-solving skills to adapt to new problems quickly and calmly that can be utilized in both my professional and educational pathways.
